# Conditional Statements - DSA

This repository contains JavaScript code demonstrating the use of conditional statements (if-else) to solve various basic problems. Each problem showcases how to use conditions effectively in different scenarios.

## ðŸ’¡ Problems Covered

### 1. Greatest of Two Numbers

* Accepts two numbers and prints the greater number.

### 2. Even or Odd

### 4. Greatest of Three Numbers

* Accepts three numbers and prints the greatest among them.
* Solved using two methods:

  * Method 2: Using logical conditions.

### 5. Leap Year Check

* Accepts a year and checks if it is a leap year.

### 6. Shop Discount Calculator

  * 5% discount for > 5000 and â‰¤ 7000.
  * 10% discount for > 7000 and â‰¤ 9000.
  * 20% discount for > 9000.

### 7. Electricity Bill Calculator

* Accepts the number of units consumed and calculates the total bill:

  * â‚¹3 per unit for first 100 units.
  * â‚¹5 per unit for next 200 units.
  * â‚¹8 per unit for units above 300.
