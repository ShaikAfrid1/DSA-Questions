# JavaScript Basics - README

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project covers the basic concepts of JavaScript, including working with numbers, strings, type coercion, and swapping variables.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Topics Covered

1. Sum of Two Integers
2. Relation Between Strings and Numbers
3. Type Coercion
4. Accepting User Input
5. Swapping Two Variables (Three Methods)

---

## ðŸ“Œ Code Explanation

### ðŸ”¹ Q1: Sum of Two Integers

* Prompts the user for two numbers and prints their sum.
* Utilizes the `Number()` function to ensure the inputs are treated as numbers.

### ðŸ”¹ Q2: Relation Between Strings and Numbers

* Demonstrates how JavaScript handles addition between strings and numbers (concatenation vs arithmetic).

### ðŸ”¹ Q3: Sum with Message

* Shows how JavaScript performs type coercion when adding numbers and strings.
* Highlights the importance of parentheses for proper calculation.

### ðŸ”¹ Q4: Accepting User Input

* Prompts the user to enter their age and displays it.

### ðŸ”¹ Q5: Swapping Two Variables

* Demonstrates three methods for swapping two variables:

  * Using a Temporary Variable
  * Using Arithmetic Operations
  * Using Destructuring Assignment (Modern Approach)

## ðŸ“Œ How to Run

1. Make sure you have Node.js installed.
2. Install prompt-sync using:

   ```bash
   npm install prompt-sync
   ```
3. Run the JavaScript file using:

   ```bash
   node filename.js
   ```

---

## ðŸ“Œ Usage

* Understand basic type coercion in JavaScript.
* Learn the difference between arithmetic and string concatenation.
* Practice different methods of swapping variables.
